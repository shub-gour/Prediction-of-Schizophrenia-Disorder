# Prediction of Schizophrenia Disorder
This project aims to predict the prevalence of schizophrenia disorder using advanced machine learning techniques. The model analyzes clinical data to provide insights into factors contributing to schizophrenia, assisting in early diagnosis and potentially improving patient outcomes.

## Project Overview
Schizophrenia is a complex mental health disorder affecting millions worldwide. This project explores the potential for machine learning to aid in predicting schizophrenia disorder. By analyzing clinical and sociodemographic data, the project aims to create a predictive model to assist in early diagnosis.

## Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Feature engineering to enhance model accuracy
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for insights
Machine learning models for classification and prediction
Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes anonymized patient records with clinical and sociodemographic information. Key features include:

Age
Gender
Family History of Schizophrenia
Symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusions)
Treatment History

## Models and Techniques
The project includes the following models and techniques:

Logistic Regression: Used as a baseline classifier.
Random Forest: Applied for its robustness to overfitting and interpretability.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Suitable for high-dimensional data.
Neural Networks: To capture complex patterns in the data.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Performed using Grid Search or Randomized Search to optimize models.

## Evaluation
Each model is evaluated using:

Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model.
Precision and Recall: For assessing true positive rates.
F1 Score: A balance of precision and recall.
Confusion Matrix: To visualize performance across classes.
